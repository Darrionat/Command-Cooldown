Created by [Darrion][Darrionat], CommandCooldown is a Spigot plugin is capable of adding cooldowns to any command.
Originally published in December 2019,
CommandCooldown has gone through a multitude of changes to end where it is.

### The Editor

To make CommandCooldown as intuitive as possible, the CommandCooldown has a GUI editor
where almost all administrative action takes place.

To open the editor use `/cc editor`.

### MySQL Support

CommandCooldown can connect to a database to store player cooldowns.
This allows for players to have a cooldown on the same command across BungeeCord.
Database connections can be enabled and configured in the `config.yml` file.
